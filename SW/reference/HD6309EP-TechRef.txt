                                    Introduction
     
     
          The  HD63B09EP  microprocessor  by  Hitachi, is a MC68B09E compatible
     chip containing additional registers and an  additional  instruction  set.
     The  6309  was  thought  to  be  a  flakey  chip  though, because it would
     sometimes crash or change the values of registers when it  encountered  an
     addressing  mode or opcode invalid to the 6809. This was later found to be
     an extended instruction set and a feature that would trap some programming
     errors and jump to a specified location in memory.
     
          Hitachi  licensed  the  rights  of  the  6809  instruction  set from
     Motorola to make a 6809 compatible chip. When they  finished  the  design,
     they  found there was a lot of unused space in the chip. With this in mind
     they added extra registers and expanded on the instruction set, but due to
     the  licensing  agreement  with  Motorola, they were unable to release the
     information about the extra features.
     
          Not only did the chip have an expanded instruction set, but  it  also
     had  a  native mode that would run many of the instructions in fewer clock
     cycles and a mode select for the FIRQ (Fast Interrupt ReQuest) that  would
     enable it to opperate the same as the IRQ.

          In fact, all new instructions will execute in emulation mode, which
     was originally seen when 'illegal' 6809 instructions produced odd results
     when run on a computer with a 6309 installed.
     
          The  additional  instruction set was first written about in the April
     1988 issue of "Oh!FM", a Japanese magazine, and was  later  brought to
     the attention of the 6809 community by Hirotsugu Kakagawa.  He followed
     up a series of '6809-6309 differences' messages on comp.sys.m6809 by
     posting a detailed
     explanation of the new features and instructions of the 6309.
     This  opened a whole new door to those who wished to
     use the 6309 in place of the 6809.
     
          The  information in this reference is of technical nature and makes no
     attempt to teach assembly language programming. It  is  ONLY  a  technical
     reference  guide for those who already know assembly and wish to use these
     features in their programs. Although all of the opcodes for the  6309/6809
     chip  are listed in the appendix, only the additional features supplied by
     the 6309 will be discussed in detail.

                        Description of Additional Registers
     
     
          The  6309  has  7  additional  registers.  Only 4 of these are actual
     registers.  2 are combinations of registers, and the last is a
     constant-value register. These registers are:
     
              ACCE  - 8 bit accumulator.
              ACCF  - 8 bit accumulator.
              W     - 16 bit concatenated register (ACCE and ACCF combined).
              Q     - 32 bit concatenated register (ACCA, ACCB ,ACCE and ACCF
                                                    combined).
              V     - 16 bit register (which can only be accessed with the
                                       inter-register instructions).
              0     - zero register
              MD    - 8 bit mode/error register.
     
     
          ACCE and ACCF both work in much the same manner as the ACCA and ACCB
     accumulators.  This  makes for easier programming in math and data oriented
     routines.
     
          The W register  is  like  the  D  register  in  the  6809.  It  is  a
     concatenated register containing the values of ACCE and ACCF as one 16 bit
     value. ACCE is contained in the high 8 bits and ACCF is contained  in  the
     low 8 bits.
     
          The  Q  register  is a 32 bit concatenated register. This register
     is composed of the concatenation of D and W, which in turn are composed of
     the registers ACCA,  ACCB, ACCE and ACCF respectively. This register is used
     mostly with the additional math instructions supplied with the 6309  which
     will be discussed later.

          The  V  register  is a 16 bit register that can only be accessed with
     inter-register instructions such a TFR and EXG.  The  contents  of  this
     register will not change if the CPU is reset, allowing this register to be
     used as a constant value for the program.

          The 0 register is always zero, independant of writes to it.
     It enables a zero value to be used in inter-register operations without
     accessing memory, or changing the value of another register.
     
          The MD register is a mode and error register and works  much  in  the
     same way as the CC register. The bit definitions are as follows:
     
           Write bits
             Bit 0   -  Execution mode of the 6309.
                         If clear ( 0 ), the cpu is in 6809 emulation mode.
                         If set ( 1 ), the cpu is in 6309 native mode.
             Bit 1   -  FIRQ mode
                         If clear ( 0 ), the FIRQ will occur normally.
                         If set ( 1 ) , the FIRQ will operate the same as the
                                        IRQ
     
             Bits 2 to 5 are unused
     
           Read bits - One of these bits is set when the 6309 traps an error
             Bit 6   -  This bit is set ( 1 ) if an illegal instruction is
                         encountered
             Bit 7   -  This bit is set ( 1 ) if a zero division occurs.

                                 Modes of Operation
     
     
          The 6309 has  two modes of operation; 6809 Emulation  mode  in  which
     the  chip  acts  and  executes instructions the same as the 6809, and 6309
     Native mode which stores an extra two bytes on the stack when an interrupt
     (IRQ) occurs, and executes instructions in fewer clock cycles.
     
          When  in  native  mode, the W register (2 additional bytes) is stored
     (PSHS) on the system stack when an interrupt occurs,  it is stored  on  the
     stack  right  after  the  D  (general data)  register. Since  ALL register
     values are stored on the system stack when an IRQ (NOT  FIRQ  -  See  FIRQ
     modes  for  more  information)   occurs,  great  care should be taken when
     writing or patching those routines to run in native mode.
     
     Pull <- CC,A,B,E*,F*,DP,Xhi,Xlo,Yhi,Ylo,Uhi,Ulo,PChi,PClo <- Push
     
       * indicates the additional registers stored on the system stack
     
     
          When in native mode those interrupt routines which modify the  return
     address  by modifying  the  10th and 11th byte offsets from the stack (STX
     10,S or STY 10,S etc.) will have to be changed to modify the 12th and 13th
     byte offsets from the stack (STX 12,S or STY 12,S etc.). If those routines
     are not patched to run in native mode they will  either  get  stuck  in  a
     continuous loop or will crash the system due to the fact that they are not
     returning to the correct address. This poses  a  MAJOR  problem  for  OS-9
     Level  II  since  its main interrupt handling routine relies highly on the
     changing of the return (PC) address on  the  stack.  Disk  read/write  and
     formatting  routines  also  rely  heavily  on  changing  the return address
     during an NMI (Non-Maskable Interrupt).
     
          To patch those routines which  do  modify  the  return  address,  the
     program  or  routine  must  be disassembled or modified with a disk sector
     editing program. Look for instructions such as STX 10,S or STY  10,S  that
     has  an  RTI (Return from Interrupt) instruction within the next few lines
     of the routine. The line containing STX 10,S or STY 10,S should be changed
     to STX 12,S or STY 12,S respectively.
     
          Remember, after those routines are patched, those programs using them
     will NOT work in emulation mode and will require native mode to be enabled
     upon startup.
     
     
     
                            Native Mode and Timing Loops
     
     
          There  is at least one more problem that needs to be addressed. Those
     are routines which are dependant on timing loops for accuarate  operation.
     Since  the  6309  executes  instructions faster when in native mode, those
     routines that use timing loops would be effected. Since this  can  pose  a
     problem  and can create erratic operation, the delay value or routine will
     need to be changed for the routine to operate correctly.
     
          Those  routines  are  usually   serial-printer   routines,   cassette
     read/write  timimg  routines,  software  clocks  and  some disk read/write
     routines.

                     Modes of the Fast Interrupt Request (FIRQ)
     
     
          The   designers   of  the  6309  decided  that  with  the  additional
     instructions and native mode of operation, the FIRQ may be used more  than
     it  usually  is.  With  this in mind they decided to allow you to make the
     FIRQ run the same as the IRQ and store (PSHS) all the  current  values  of
     the  registers  on the system stack. Normally, the FIRQ only stores the CC
     (condition code) and the PC (Program Counter/return address) on the stack,
     so  to  keep compatability with the 6809, they included it as a selectable
     feature in the MD (Mode/status) register.
     
     
     
                            Inter-Register Instructions
     
     
          The new Inter-Register instructions (ADCR,  ADDR,  CMPR,  EORR,  ORR,
     SBCR,  and  SUBR)  all work the same as their register/memory (ADCA, ADDA,
     etc.) counterparts except that they operate between registers. All of  the
     new  instructions  use  the  same  post-byte information as the normal TFR
     instruction and use the  format  of  R0,R1  (register  0  and  Register  1
     respectively)  with  the  result  going  into  R1. See Block Transfers for
     information on the TFR block move instructions.

          Mixed-size inter-register operations default to using
     identical sized register.  So TFR A,X actually executes as TFR D,X.
     You could also do 'lea(d) d,pc' calculations by doing 'addr pc,d'.  As
     the new inter-register instructions can now perform math using the PC
     register, REALLY odd possibilities exist.  Try looking at code like
     'eorr d,pc', and figuring out where it ends up.

          Inter-register instructions with 16-bit r1 and CC or DP (8-bit r2)
     are legal, but the results are unknown.

     
                        Bit Manipulation of Memory Locations
     
     
          The  AIM,  EIM,  OIM  and  TIM  instructions  all  do   logical   bit
     manipulations  to  locations  in  memory,  with the result stored into the
     location, and the respective bits for  each  instruction  set  in  the  CC
     register.  They  can be  used in the DIRECT, INDEXED or EXTENDED adressing
     modes.
     
       Instruction descriptions:
     
        AIM - AND IN MEMORY
        EIM - EOR IN MEMORY
        OIM - OR IN MEMORY
        TIM - TEST bits IN MEMORY
     
       Instruction format: X, post byte, operand
     
          Where X is the instruction op-code, post-byte contains  the  bits  to
     AND,  OR,  EOR or TEST against the memory location, and the operand is the
     memory location or indexing post-byte depending on the mode of operation.
     
     
       Mnemonic format:
     
        Instruction logical operation value, memory location or index operation
     
       Mnemonic example:
     
        AIM #$0F,$E00 
       
      The example takes the contents of memory location $E00,  does  a  LOGICAL
     and with the Value #$0F and then stores the result back into $E00.

                Bit Transfers Between Memory Locations and Registers
     
     
          The  BAND, BIAND, BOR, BIOR,  BEOR,  BIEOR,  LDBT,  and  STBT  all do
     logical  operations  to bits for the n-th bit in a memory location and the
     m-th bit of a register. The  LDBT  and  STBT  instructions  allow  you  to
     transfer   certain  bits  between  registers  and  memory  locations.  All
     instructions allow you  to  specify  which  register  to  use,  which  bit
     location  to  use in the register, which bit location to use in the memory
     location, and the memory location to use. This allows you  to  transfer/or
     do a logical operation with the 7th bit of a register and the 3rd bit of a
     memory location. All bits are accessible on either the register or  memory
     locations. The only limitations are that the instructions can only be used
     with the A and B accumulators and the CC (condition  Code)  registers.  It
     should  also  be  noted  that  these  instructions can only be used in the
     DIRECT addressing mode.
     
       Instruction description:
     
       BAND  - AND a bit in a register with bit from memory location
       BIAND - AND a bit in a register with the complement of the bit in memory
       BOR   - OR a bit in a register with a bit from a memory location
       BIOR  - OR a bit in a register with the complement of the bit in memory
       BEOR  - EOR a bit in a register with a bit from a memory location
       BIEOR - EOR a bit in a register with the complement of the bit in memory
       LDBT  - Load a bit from a memory location into a bit in a register
       STBT  - Store a bit from a register into a memory location.
     
     
       Instruction format:
     
        x, post-byte, memory location
     
          Where X is  the  instruction  op-code,  the  post-byte  contains  the
     register,  source  and destination bit information and the memory location
     is the 8 bit value of the memory location to be used (Remember only DIRECT
     mode is allowed with these instructions).
     
     
       Mnemonic format:
     
        instruction, register, source bit, destination bit, memory location
     
     
       Mnemonic example:
     
        BOR A,1,7,$00
     
          The  example would take the first (1) bit of register A (A) and OR it
     into the 7th (7) bit of memory location $00 ($00) of the direct  page  (DP
     register value)
     
          The post-byte of these instructions are not the same as the post-byte
     used in any other operation (indexed or  inter-register)  as  all  of  the
     information  (register,  source  and  destination bit) is contained in one
     post-byte value.

                                  Block Transfers
     
     
          Block  transfers  are used to move a certain number of bytes from one
     place in memory to another with the use of one  instruction.  Two  16  bit
     registers  (X,  Y,  U or S) are used to specify the source and destination
     addresses, and the size of the block to be transferred is  specified  with
     the  W register. It should be noted that even though the IRQ and FIRQ only
     occur after  the current  instruction  is  finished,  block  moves  can be
     interrupted.  After the interrupt returns, the last byte read is read once
     more.  i.e. It is read _twice_ by the CPU  This can  cause  problems  with
     memory  mapped  I/O devices, so caution  is advised  when using  the block
     transfers. There isn't much control over these 4 instructions so the  only
     thing applicable for them would be large block moves such as scrolling the
     screen or clearing an area in memory with a certain value.
     
          TFM r0+,r1 and TFM r0,r1+ can be considered a poor mans DMA  channel.
     Since all the data is either copied into or read from one memory location.
     
       Four types of block transfers have been provided.
     
       Mnemonic examples:
     
        (R0 - source address register, R1 - destination address register.)
     
       TFM r0+,r1+
        - Transfer from R0 to R1 in incrementing order.
     
     
       TFM r0-,r1-
        - Transfer from R0 to R1 in decrementing order.
     
     
       TFM r0+,r1
        - Pour from R0 into R1, only incrementing R0 (R1 stays the same).
     
     
       TFM r0,r1+
        - Read from R0 into R1, only incrementing R0 (R1 stays the same).
     
     
       Mnemonic example:
     
        LDW #$100
        LDX #$600
        LDY #$700
        TFM X+,Y+
     
     
          The example would move 256 (LDW #$0100) bytes from #$600 (LDX #$0600) in
     memory to #$700 (LDY #$0700) in memory,  incrementing  the  value  of  each
     register (X and Y), and decrementing the value of the W register each time
     a byte if moved.
     
          When moves like this are done, the pointer registers (X and Y in  the
     example)  will  not  be  the  same value they were before the transfer was
     initiated, but will but will be their original values PLUS  the  value  of
     the  W register (#$100 in the example). So in the example once the move is
     complete, the value of X will be returned as #$700 and the value of Y will
     be returned as #$800. The value of W register will be 0.

          It is illegal to use any of the CC, DP, W, V, 0, or PC registers
     as either a source or destination register.  Note that the D register
     CAN be used with the TFM instructions.

                                 New math commands
     
     
          The 6309 has 3 additional math instructions.  A  16  bit  by  16  bit
     signed  multiply  (MULD),  a 16 bit by 8 bit signed divide (DIVD) and a 32
     bit by 16 bit signed divide (DIVQ). These instructions can all be used  in
     Immediate, direct, indexed and extended addressing modes.
     
          The MULD (16 bit by 16 bit) instruction does a signed multiply of the
     contents of the D register and a value from memory (or  in  direct  mode).
     The signed result is stored in the Q register.
     
          The  DIVD  (16  bit by 8 bit) instruction does a signed divide of the
     contents of the D register with a value from memory (or in  direct  mode).
     The  signed  result  is  stored  with  the  quotient  in  W and the modulo
     (remainder) in D.
     
          The DIVQ (32 bit by 16 bit) instruction does a signed divide  of  the
     contents  of  the Q register with a value from memory (or in direct mode).
     The signed result is  stored  with  the  quotient  in  W  and  the  modulo
     (remainder) in D.
     
     
     
                                   Error Trapping
     
     
          The  6309  has an internal error trapping handler that will jump to a
     specific location in memory when either an error  is  encountered  in  the
     DIVision  instructions  (only divide by zero) or an illegal instruction is
     encountered.  When an  error is  encountered, the  6309  will  jump to the
     memory  location  contained  in  $FFF0 (and $FFF1)  which  was  originally
     reserved by the 6809.
     
          The trap may cause  problems with machines that  have $FF00 hardcoded
     with  the  values $0000.  A new EPROM should  be burned to correct for the
     new behaviour of the 6309.

          As many people  know, an illegal instruction trap  is extremely useful
     for debugging  programs,  as it prevents  the entire machine  from crashing
     when a bug is encountered.

          Note that many pseudo-legal instructions on the 6809 are now illegal
     on the 6309, e.g. $1020xxxx executes as an LBRA on a 6809, but results in
     a trap on a 6309.     


                              Additional Instructions
     
     
          The  6309  has  MANY  new  instructions.  Most  are variations of old
     instructions of  the  6809  for  use  with  the  new  registers.  The  new
     instruction  set  can be used in both native and emulation mode. Here is a
     list of the new instructions of the 6309:
     
     
       ADCD

          The Opcode and Mnemonics opcode reference tables  are  both  complete
     listings  that  contain both the Opcode instruction and the HEX equivalant
     in  all  available  addressing  modes.  The  first   table   is   arranged
     sequentially  by  the  binary  opcodes, while the second table is arranged
     alphabetically by the Mnemonic instructions.
     
          At the end of the second  table  there are   data  tables  containing
     information    on    Bit   transfer/manipulation,   branch   instructions,
     inter-register instructions, and general register and  stack  information.
     These  are  all  helpful  to the serious assembly language programmer, who
     should always have one.

        Both  the  source  and  destination  bit  portions of the post-byte are
   looked at by the 6309 as the actual bit NUMBER to  transfer/store.  Use  the

       The PSH(s,u) and PUL(s,u) instructions require one additional
       cycle for each byte pushed or pulled.




  Alan DeKok's addition to the above...


  The new features of the 6309 are closely related to the changes in
design from the 6809.  The 6309 is micro-coded, which allowed the
designers to easily add new instrctions and registers.  It also has a
one byte pre-fetch 'cache', which enables the 6309 to execute
instructions like 'lsld' (2-bytes) in one clock cycle.  The design of
the 6809 series allows them to read one byte per clock cycle MAXIMUM, but there
is a catch.  Most instructions take more clock cycles to execute than
bytes they contain.  While the 6309 is performing internal
calculations, the 'cache' hardware goes and reads the next instruction
byte, leaving only one additional byte to be read to execute the 'lsld'.
Reading this byte requires one clock cycle, and then the instruction
is executed while the CPU fetches the next instruction.


  The 6309 has a true 16-bit internal design.
e.g. the EXG instruction operates as
6809: read op-code
      read inter-register byte (r0,r1)
        r0_high -> temp_high
        r0_low  -> temp_low
        r1_high -> r0_high
        r1_low  -> r0_low
        r0_high -> r1_high
        r0_low  -> r1_low

  8 actions, 8 clock cycles.

6809: read op-code
      read inter-register byte (r0,r1)
        r0 -> temp
        r1 -> r0
        r0 -> r1

  5 actions, 5 clock cycles.


  The 6309 native mode instruction execution clock lengths can be mostly accounted
for by accounting for the pre-fetch cache and the internal 16-bit ALU.

  TFM has some caveats. TFM r1-,r2- should NOT be used to setup the
stack, as it's a POST-decrement instruction, not PRE-decrement.

  Watch out for TFM r1,r2+ if you're reading from a peripherial.
Why?  The TFM uses the 1-byte 'cache' as an internal buffer for the
byte that it's currently moving.  The TFM instruction is interruptible
(the only instruction that is), and code execution during the
interrupt will destroy the byte in the cache.

   On returning from the interrupt, the TFM will read the FROM
address again to get the lost byte, which may be the wrong one.  The
visible effect of this is that block moves sometimes have a byte
missing from the middle, and everything after that byte shifted down
one address.

  There are a few ways of checking of you're running on a 6309 or a 6809,
these include:

:
 tfr 0,d  -> illegal registers are '$FFFF' on a 6809, $0000 on a 6309
 tstb     ->
 beq  Is6309
:

:
 ldb #$ff
 clrd      -> executes as a $10 (ignored) $4F (clra) on a 6809
 tstb
 beq  Is6309
:


  It's a bit harder to check if the system is running in native mode or not.
Most of the time it won't be necessary, but the only realy method is to do:
:
 pshs cc,d,dp,x,y,u  SAVE ALL REGISTERS AS CHECKING WILL TRASH THEM
 leax Is6309,pc
 pshs  x               save address of 6309 flag code
 leax Is6809,pc
 pshs  x               save address of 6809 flag code
 pshs  cc,d,dp,x,y,u   save registers
 orcc #ENTIRE          set to ALL registers on-stack
 rti                   go to 6309/6809 code

Is6309 clr <Flag   it's a 6309
 bra Continue

Is6809 leas 2,s   account for 6309 PC
  lda #$FF
  sta <Flag       

Continue puls cc,d,dp,x,y,u  restore all registers
[etc...]
:

  Note that the checks for both 6809/6309 and native/emulation will execute
perfectly on both 6809 and 6309 systems, and will give the correct results
in all cases.

  In order to check for 6309 FIRQ operation (i.e. all registers saved),
you'd have to do something like

[ enable FIRQ's ]
:
 leau -3,s       where stack will be if only CC and PC are saved
 stu <test       remember the pointer
loop tst <check  FIRQ happened yet?
  bne loop       no, wait for an FIRQ
[...]

FIRQ cmps <test  only CC, PC saved?
 bne  Is6309F    no, it's 6309 FIRQ mode
 clr <F.Flag     set to 6809 IRQ mode
 bra continue

Is6309F lda #$FF don't bother saving A as 6309 FIRQ mode already saves it
 sta <F.Flag     set the FIRQ flag

continue clr <check         we've done an FIRQ, so we can exit
 rti
:

  The W,E, and F registers do not have the full immediate addressing
mode capabilities that D,A, and B do.  SBC, AND, BIT, EOR, ADC, OR
with E,F,W are available only in register-register mode.  LSR, ROR,
ROL are available for W but not for E,F.  ASR, ASL, LSL, NEG do not
exist at all for W,E,F.

  ASL can sort of be implemented by doing a ADDR R1,R1.  (see later)

  You can also do things like 'leax u,x' by doing a ADDR u,x.

  Sadly, many of the new 6309 instructions are useless in everyday
life.  The bit manipulation instructions are interesting, but slow and
mostly of limited value.  Same with much of the DIV/MUL higher math.  The
AIM, etc. are very useful, though.


  Programmer recommendations


  Try to stay away from using the W register.  It's got another pre-byte
(like instructions using 'Y' or 'S'), and is correspondingly larger
and slower.  E and F are best used mainly instead of pushing loop counters onto
the stack when you're running out of registers.

  The V register is mostly pointless.  If you're doing context
switches, it isn't saved across interrupts unless you do so manually.
Shuffling data back and forth between other registers and V is a lot
of trouble.  Any math, etc. involving V is generally done much faster
using a real register.  After going through 1meg+ of 6309 assembly code
which is everything from an OS kernel to serial drivers to graphics
drivers, I've never seen a use for the V register.

  Of course, you could put '$FFFF' into V, and have registers for
reg-reg addressing modes with bits all zero (0), and another with bits all
1 (V).

  Pseudo-nops: tfr 0,0; exg 0,0

  Extremely small software timing loops with large delays may be generated
by performing a 'LDW',and then 'TFM r0,r0+'.

  Many programs can be executed in 6309 native mode by patching only
the IRQ code, if it accesses the stack.  A 'LDMD #$01' may be
performed as soon as your program starts executing, and will see an
immediate 10-15% speed increase.  Software timing loops must be
checked!
