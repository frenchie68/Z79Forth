1 The Core words
----------------

1.1 Implementation-defined options
----------------------------------
- aligned address requirements (3.1.3.3 Addresses):
  There are no address alignment requirements in this implementation.

- behavior of 6.1.1320 EMIT for non-graphic characters:
  The character is output to the terminal over the HD63B50 ACIA.

- character editing of 6.1.0695 ACCEPT and 6.2.1390 EXPECT:
  The serial line input routine (GETS) offers limited command line editing
  functions. They are:
  . <BackSpace> (ASCII byte 8): erase the previously entered character if any
    and move the cursor backward by one character.
  . <Kill-Input> (ASCII byte 21): erases all characters already entered and
    point to the beginning of the buffer.

- character set (3.1.2 Character types, 6.1.1320 EMIT, 6.1.1750 KEY):
  The character set used by the terminal emulator or terminal device.

- character-aligned address requirements (3.1.3.3 Addresses):
  There are no alignment requirements for characters.

- character-set-extensions matching characteristics (3.4.2 Finding definition
  names): a safe character range for dictionary entries is hex 21 to hex 7E.
  Word names matching is case insensitive.

- conditions under which control characters match a space delimiter
  (3.4.1.1 Delimiters): carriage return (ASCII 13) is accepted as a space
  delimiter by WORD.

- format of the control-flow stack (3.2.3.2 Control-flow stack):
  Control flow constructs have been re-implemented based on Wonyong Koh's
  hForth for the 8086. The original code can be consulted at
  https://github.com/nealcrook/hForth. Of particular interest is
  8086/HF86RAM.ASM. Entries on the control flow stack (implemented on the
  data stack here) are two cell entities that consist of a parameter
  (an address), on the top of which a tag identifying the type of address
  is pushed. They are:
 
  Control-flow stack item    Representation (parameter and type)
  -----------------------    -------------------------------------
  dest                       control-flow destination      0
  orig                       control-flow origin           1
  of-sys                     OF origin                     2
  case-sys                   x (any value)                 3
  do-sys                     ?DO origin                    DO destination
  colon-sys                  xt of current definition     -1 [1]
 
  [1] Not implemented in Z79Forth/A.
 
  This mechanism allows for verification of balanced control flow constructs.

- conversion of digits larger than thirty-five (3.2.1.2 Digit conversion):
  The valid range for BASE is 2 .. 36. There is no possible representation
  for a digit larger than 35.

- display after input terminates in 6.1.0695 ACCEPT and 6.2.1390 EXPECT:
  The cursor is moved to the end of the entered string. If the input is
  terminated using the Enter key, a space is typed.

- exception abort sequence (as in 6.1.0680 ABORT"): the string passed as an
  argument is displayed to the terminal and the error handler is invoked with
  the error code 3 (User ABORT). Please note that exceptions are not supported.

- input line terminator (3.2.4.1 User input device): CarriageReturn (ASCII 13)
  is the input line terminator.

- maximum size of a counted string, in characters (3.1.3.4 Counted strings,
  6.1.2450 WORD): 255 characters.

- maximum size of a parsed string (3.4.1 Parsing): The command line buffer
  size is defined via CMDBFSZ in constants.asm. The current value is 132.

- maximum size of a definition name, in characters (3.3.1.2 Definition names):
  31 characters.

- maximum string length for 6.1.1345 ENVIRONMENT?, in characters: ENVIRONMENT?
  always returns false.

- method of selecting 3.2.4.1 User input device: the input device always is
  the ACIA wired at address DEV6 ($D800 as defined in constants.asm).

- method of selecting 3.2.4.2 User output device: the output device always is
  the ACIA wired at address DEV6 ($D800 as defined in constants.asm).

- methods of dictionary compilation (3.3 The Forth dictionary): native HD6309
  code is generated. There is no virtual machine involved.

- number of bits in one address unit (3.1.3.3 Addresses): there are 8 bits per
  byte.

- number representation and arithmetic (3.2.1.1 Internal number representation):
  One cell is two bytes long. It is stored in memory with the most signficant
  byte first, in binary two’s complement form.

- ranges for n, +n, u, d, +d, and ud (3.1.3 Single-cell types,
  3.1.4 Cell-pair types):

  Symbol  Data type                        Cells  Range
  ------  ---------                        -----  -----
  n       signed number                    1      -32,768..32,767
  +n      non-negative number              1      0..32,767
  u       unsigned number                  1      0..65,535
  d       double-cell signed number        2      -2,147,483,648..2,147,483,647
  +d      double-cell non-negative number  2      0..2,147,483,647
  ud      double-cell unsigned number      2      0..4,294,967,295

- read-only data-space regions (3.3.3 Data space): this is a ROM resident
  implementation. Data at addresses between $E000 and $FFFF are not modifiable.
  Words between @ and EMPTY-BUFFERS (in dictionary search order) may not be
  disposed of--FORGET has been deprecated in this implementation.

- size of buffer at 6.1.2450 WORD (3.3.3.6 Other transient regions): a parsed
  string length may never exceed the maximum size of a counted string, if
  entered from the interpreter. WORD itself does not check for overflow.

- size of one cell in address units (3.1.3 Single-cell types): a cell is two
  bytes long.

- size of one character in address units (3.1.2 Character types): a character
  is one byte long.

- size of the keyboard terminal input buffer (3.3.3.5 Input buffers):
  The command line buffer size is defined via CMDBFSZ in constants.asm.
  The current value is 132.

- size of the pictured numeric output string buffer (3.3.3.6 Other transient
  regions): PADBSZ (defined in constants.asm) is currently 84. 

- size of the scratch area whose address is returned by 6.2.2000 PAD
  (3.3.3.6 Other transient regions): PADBSZ (defined in constants.asm) is
  currently 84.

- system case-sensitivity characteristics (3.4.2 Finding definition names):
  the system is case insensitive by default. This behaviour can be changed
  by re-compiling the EEPROM image with CSSNTVE set to a non-zero value
  (see constants.asm).

- system prompt (3.4 The Forth text interpreter, 6.1.2050 QUIT): there is no
  system prompt. The OK feedback string is " ok" in case insensitive mode,
  " OK" in case sensitive mode. There is no feedback whatsoever when compiling.

- type of division rounding (3.2.2.1 Integer division, 6.1.0100 */, 6.1.0110
  */MOD, 6.1.0230 /, 6.1.0240 /MOD, 6.1.1890 MOD): floored division is used.

- values of 6.1.2250 STATE when true: 255.

- values returned after arithmetic overflow (3.2.2.2 Other integer operations):
  when arithmetic overflows occur and are detected, control is transferred to
  the error handler under error code 4 ('OoR error'). No value is returned to
  the application.

- whether the current definition can be found after 6.1.1250 DOES> (6.1.0450 :):
  no. 

1.2 Ambiguous conditions
------------------------
Generic error conditions:

- a name is neither a valid definition name nor a valid number during text
  interpretation (3.4 The Forth text interpreter): control is transferred to
  the error handler under error code 2 ('?' undefined word).

- a definition name exceeded the maximum length allowed (3.3.1.2 Definition
  names): control is transferred to the error handler under error code 16
  ('Word name too long').

- addressing a region not listed in 3.3.3 Data Space: may result in
  unpredictable outcomes.

- argument type incompatible with specified input parameter, e.g., passing a
  flag to a word expecting an n (3.1 Data types): this will most likely go
  undetected and lead to erratic behaviour of the system. The control flow
  stack offers some limited data type management but only to the extent
  necessary to ensure the sanity of control flow constructs used by a program.

- attempting to obtain the execution token, (e.g., with 6.1.0070 ',
  6.1.1550 FIND, etc.) of a definition with undefined interpretation semantics:
  will result in the actual execution being returned, regardless of the state
  of the 'compilation only' flag. Applying EXECUTE to such a token will result
  in the execution token to be run, as one would expect.

- dividing by zero (6.1.0100 */, 6.1.0110 */MOD, 6.1.0230 /, 6.1.0240 /MOD,
  6.1.1561 FM/MOD, 6.1.1890 MOD, 6.1.2214 SM/REM, 6.1.2370 UM/MOD,
  8.6.1.1820 M*/):
  + */ */MOD / /MOD and MOD: a 6309 division by zero trap occurs. Control will
    be transferred to the error handler under error code 3 ("User ABORT').
  + FM/MOD SM/REM and UM/MOD: Control will
    be transferred to the error handler under error code 4 ("OoR error').
  + M*/ is unsupported.

- insufficient data-stack space or return-stack space (stack overflow):
  + data stack: the error handler is invoked with error code 0 ('Data stack
    overflow').
  + return stack: the error handler is invoked with error code 7 ('Return stack
    overflow').

- insufficient space for loop-control parameters: a return stack overflow
  condition is triggered (see above).

- insufficient space in the dictionary: this will go undetected leading to
  a complete system failure due to an inconsistent dictionary state.

- interpreting a word with undefined interpretation semantics: if this happens
  via the interpreter, control will be transferred to the error handler with
  error code 6 ('Incorrect STATE'). However this can also be achieved by using
  ' and then applying EXECUTE to the execution token returned, in which case no
  error condition will be detected but unexepected system behaviour is likely
  to emerge.

- modifying the contents of the input buffer or a string literal
  (3.3.3.4 Text-literal regions, 3.3.3.5 Input buffers): These are located in
  writable memory and can be modified.

- overflow of a pictured numeric output string: this is unlikely to ever happen
  in the real world. The output buffer for pictured numeric output strings
  offers 83 bytes of user data, which seems adequate even under the worst
  possible use case.

- parsed string overflow: this condition may occur when parsing from blocks.
  It will be undetected. WORD does not check for overflow.

- producing a result out of range, e.g., multiplication (using *) results in a
  value too big to be represented by a single-cell integer (6.1.0090 *,
  6.1.0100 */, 6.1.0110 */MOD, 6.1.0570 >NUMBER, 6.1.1561 FM/MOD,
  6.1.2214 SM/REM, 6.1.2370 UM/MOD, 6.2.0970 CONVERT, 8.6.1.1820 M*/);
  + * will not detect overflow conditions. If reliable artithmetic is needed
    M* should be used instead.
  + */ and */MOD do not generate overflow conditions.
  + >NUMBER will transfer control to the error handler under error code
    4 ("OoR error').
  + FM/MOD SM/REM UM/MOD may or may not detect overflow conditions. Should this
    happen, control would be transferred to the error handler under error code
    4 ("OoR error').
  + CONVERT and M*/ are not unsupported.

- reading from an empty data stack or return stack (stack underflow);
  + data stack: the error handler is invoked with error code 1 ('Data stack
    underflow').
  + return stack: the error handler is invoked with error code 8 ('Return stack
    underflow').

- unexpected end of input buffer, resulting in an attempt to use a zero-length
  string as a name: control is transferred to the error handler under error
  code 5 ('Missing word name'). This applies to : CREATE VARIABLE and CONSTANT.

Word specific error conditions:
- >IN greater than size of input buffer (3.4.1 Parsing): control will be
  transferred to the error handler under error code 18 ('>IN Out of range').

- 6.1.2120 RECURSE appears after 6.1.1250 DOES>: this condition is undetected.
  RECURSE will simply issue a call to the word being defined (in DOES> context).

- argument input source different than current input source for 6.2.2148
  RESTORE-INPUT: not applicable as RESTORE-INPUT is not supported.

- data space containing definitions is de-allocated (3.3.3.2 Contiguous
  regions): only MARKER and ALLOT with a negative byte count provide a way
  of de-allocating dictionary space. MARKER is safe whereas ALLOT could lead
  to situations where existing dictionary header entries exist past the
  current value of HERE. Should this happen, chaos is guaranteed to ensue.
  Additional consideration: Z79Forth/A also supports a few Forth2012 primitives
  such as DEFER DEFER! DEFER@ IS and ACTION-OF. It should be noted that
  release of data space containing definitions could lead to cached (DEFERred)
  references of memory locations that are no longer available. This also is
  a potential recipe for system instability.

- data space read/write with incorrect alignment (3.3.3.1 Address alignment):
  there are no alignment requirements.

- data-space pointer not properly aligned (6.1.0150 ,, 6.1.0860 C,): there are
  no alignment requirements.

- less than u+2 stack items (6.2.2030 PICK, 6.2.2150 ROLL): control is
  transferred to the error handler under error code 13 ('Invalid argument').

- loop-control parameters not available ( 6.1.0140 +LOOP, 6.1.1680 I,
  6.1.1730 J, 6.1.1760 LEAVE, 6.1.1800 LOOP, 6.1.2380 UNLOOP): control is
  transferred to the error handler under error code 7 ('Return stack undeflow').

- most recent definition does not have a name (6.1.1710 IMMEDIATE): unchecked.
  IMMEDIATE only applies to the most recently named definition.

- name not defined by 6.2.2405 VALUE used by 6.2.2295 TO: unchecked. This
  will only work if the name in question was a CONSTANT, which is very close
  to what VALUE comes down to.

- name not found (6.1.0070 ', 6.1.2033 POSTPONE, 6.1.2510 ['],
  6.2.2530 [COMPILE]): control is transferred to the error handler under error
  code 2 ('?' undefined word).

- parameters are not of the same type (6.1.1240 DO, 6.2.0620 ?DO,
  6.2.2440 WITHIN): Parameters are treated as if they were of the same type.

- 6.1.2033 POSTPONE or 6.2.2530 [COMPILE] applied to 6.2.2295 TO: a call to
  TO will be compiled, resulting in correct behaviour. [COMPILE] is not
  supported.

- string longer than a counted string returned by 6.1.2450 WORD: unchecked. The
  string will be ok, but the count will, of course, contain only the least
  significant bits of the length.

- u greater than or equal to the number of bits in a cell (6.1.1805 LSHIFT,
  6.1.2162 RSHIFT): 0 is returned.

- word not defined via 6.1.1000 CREATE (6.1.0550 >BODY, 6.1.1250 DOES>):
  control is transferred to the error handler under error code 14 ('No matching
  CREATE').

- words improperly used outside 6.1.0490 <# and 6.1.0040 #> (6.1.0030 #,
  6.1.0050 #S, 6.1.1670 HOLD, 6.1.2210 SIGN): unchecked. If the data stack is
  empty when this happens a data stack underflow condition will be triggered.
  Otherwise the system is likely to misbehave.

1.3 Other system documentation
--------------------------------
This whole implementation assumes that the Z79Forth reference board is used.
Kicad 5 schematics and the corresponding PDF file are included in this
distribution. The reference board may also be called the validated use case.

1.3.1 Words using PAD
---------------------
None. PAD is defined and available to the programmer for temporary storage.
No words use it for their own purpose. Contrary to common practice in some
other systems, PAD resides at a fixed address and is exactly 84 bytes long.

Pictured numbers string representation is stored in a buffer of the same size,
whose address is not directly available to the programmer. WORD's output is to
HERE, i.e. the current end of the dictionary.

1.3.2 System conformance upon boot
----------------------------------
Z79Forth/A is an EEPROM resident implementation. Which means that most words
from the Core wordset are immediately available. However the following words
are defined in CompactFlash storage: >BODY ABORT" ENVIRONMENT? LSHIFT RSHIFT
and WITHIN. On a fully functional system where the supplied CompactFlash image
has been transferred to a medium, they will be transparently loaded (block #1
will be auto-loaded).

1.3.3 System dictionary space
-----------------------------
The system dictionary occupies about 5.5 KB of EEPROM space. On the top of this
about 2 KB of material is automatically loaded from CompactFlash storage. The
file all-words.txt in the SW/doc directory documents which are EEPROM resident
(E prefix) or loaded from mass storage (C prefix).

1.3.4 Application dictionary space
----------------------------------
Upon system initialization, the ROM based flavor of '@' is relocated to SRAM,
starting at the address WDICSPC (see SW/src/constants.asm for details). After
the material loaded automatically from mass storage is in and taking into
account the space required for global variables and buffers, this leaves about
26 KB of application space. This can be verified interactively by resorting to:

        UNUSED .

1.3.5 Return stack space
------------------------
The return stack size is configurable through the RSTKSZ tunable parameter
(defined in SW/src/constants.asm) and is expressed in bytes. It defaults to
128 (64 cells). The RPICKN implementation contraints it to be no higher than
510 bytes (255 cells).

1.3.6 Data stack space
----------------------
The data stack size is configurable through the NSTKSZ tunable parameter
(defined in SW/src/constants.asm) and is expressed in bytes. It defaults to
192 (96 cells). The upper limit is only constrained by the SRAM size.

1.3.7 Mass storage requirements
-------------------------------
The mass storage device used by the Z79Forth reference board is a SanDisk
CompactFlash device programmed in 8 bit mode. There is no minimum storage
requirement. Z79Forth will work even in the absence of a CF card. However,
the following standard words are expected to be loaded from mass storage:

Core word set:		ABORT" >BODY ENVIRONMENT? LSHIFT RSHIFT
Core ext word set:	.( 2>R 2R> 2R@ ERASE TO UNUSED VALUE WITHIN
Tools word set:		DUMP SEE
String word set:	/STRING -TRAILING

The maximum number of addressable blocks is the full range of unsigned block
numbers (64 MB).

1.3.8 An operator's terminal
----------------------------
In the validated use case, this is provided by an HD63B50 ACIA whose base
address is defined by ACIACTL and ACIADAT (see SW/src/constants.asm).

The default ACIA settings assume a 1.84320 MHz oscillator, optionally divided
by 3 through a pair of D type latches. The baud rate is further divided by 16
by chip configuration, thus resulting in a 115200 bps line rate (8N1 is also
programmed). However, reliability problems have been observed when repeatedly
cut & pasting large blocks of text at very short time intervals. The divide
by 3 path (38400 bps operation) is highly recommended.

RTS/CTS flow control is implemented on input. Asynchronous serial input is
interrupt driven. Character input is queued to a 64 byte FIFO and dequeued
whenever GETCH is invoked. Character output supports software flow control
(XON/OFF).

The preferred user interface to the ACIA is Minicom under Linux (other options
might work as well, YMMV). An input line will be considered as terminated upon
reception of a CR character (hex $0D). No extra LF (hex $0A) character is
expected. The input processing routine provides support for cooked input.
Supported control codes are:

- erase (^H) implements the traditional backspace semantics.
- kill (^U) erases all characters up to the beginning of the line, in a Unix
  like manner.
- intr (^C) interrupts the normal flow of execution and resumes control in
  the error handler, as if ABORT had been called from Forth code.

The recommended terminal size is 25 lines by 80 columns. DUMP (see SW/examples/
dump.4th) assumes 80 columns are available. LWVI only requires 18 lines by 64
columns.

2 The optional Block word set
-----------------------------

2.1 Implementation-defined options
----------------------------------
- the format for display by LIST: the screen passed as an argument is displayed
  as 16 lines of 64 characters. The text is shown exactly as it is in the
  loaded block--nothing is added.

- the length of a line affected by \: 64 characters.

2.2 Ambiguous conditions
------------------------
- correct block read was not possible: this can happen in one of two
  situations: either the CompactFlash was not detected on bootup or an I/O
  error occurred. In either case, control is transferred to the error handler
  under error code 17 ('IO error').

- I/O exception in block transfer: control is transferred to the error handler
  under error code 17 ('IO error').

- invalid block number: this is not possible if the minimum storage requirements
  are met (i.e. a minimum of 128 MB of CompactFlash).

- a program directly alters the contents of BLK: execution continues in the
  new block (transparently loaded) at the current >IN offset.

- no current block buffer for UPDATE: UPDATE has no effect.

2.3 Other system documentation:
-------------------------------
- any restrictions a multiprogramming system places on the use of buffer
  addresses: no restictions. It should be noted that multiprogramming is
  not officially supported. There is only one global user context available.

- the number of blocks available for source and data: only limited by the
  cell representation of an unsigned number: 65536.

3 The optional Facility word set
--------------------------------

3.1 Implementation-defined options
----------------------------------
- duration of a system clock tick: there is no periodic interruption is the
  validated use case. MS's waiting period is specified in milliseconds.

- repeatability to be expected from the execution of MS: pretty good indeed.
  This is implemented as busy waiting and must be calibrated at EEPROM
  compilation time (see SW/src/constants.asm, MSLCNT definition).

4 The optional Programming-Tools word set
-----------------------------------------

4.1 Implementation-defined options
----------------------------------
- source and format of display by SEE: a disassembly listing is provided.
  Only a few 6309 operation codes are supported: LXI (ldx immediate), JSR, JMP
  and RTS. Anything else is mapped to FCB (form constant byte). The disassembler
  is supplied in SW/examples/dis.4th and resides in blocks 90 to 94 in the
  default CompactFlash image.

4.2 Ambiguous conditions
------------------------
- FORGET removes a word required for correct execution: FORGET is not
  implemented in Z79Forth/A. MARKER is to be used instead.

- fewer than u+1 items on the control-flow stack (CS-PICK, CS-ROLL): CS-PICK
  and CS-ROLL are not implemented in Z79Forth/A.

- name can’t be found (FORGET): FORGET is not implemented in Z79Forth/A.

- name not defined via CREATE: ;CODE is not implemented in Z79Forth/A.

- POSTPONE applied to [IF]: [IF] is not implemented in Z79Forth/A.

- reaching the end of the input source before matching [ELSE] or [THEN]:
  [ELSE] and [THEN] are not implemented in Z79Forth/A.

- removing a needed definition (FORGET): FORGET is not implemented in
  Z79Forth/A.
